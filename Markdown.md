## How to use the program
- Just build the program and run
- You can type in commands like:

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Place | The format is X coordinate, Y coordinate, Direction the Robot is facing (Place 1,2,North)|
| Move | The robot will move forward the direction he is facing |
| Left | The robot will face left |
| Right | The robot will face right |
| Report | Outputs the 'X,Y,Facing' data |
| Exit | Exits the application |

## Unit tests
I've added in a few which can be ran after building the solution. Thank you.
